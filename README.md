LARAVEL VUE APP(CRUD)

With this app, you can Create, Update, Delete, View and show notifications every after action.
There is also a table to show the data from the submitted form. Everything is "ansyc" meaning that there is no need for the page to refresh in order to see the data in the table. 
You should be able to see the data immediately after inserting the form into the database.
Please make sure that you have laravel and vue installed in your project.
